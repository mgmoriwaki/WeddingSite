                                                    Alex packed up lunch and we hopped in the car. We ended up in Kensington
                                                    at the town park. In high school we often went there after taking Buddy

                                                    the sun and Alex ever so casually told me how much I mean to him, basically
                                                    greasing my wheels to work his way up to the big question.

                                                    I turned around to find him down on one knee holding something quite
                                                    sparkly, "Will you marry me?" Of course I blurted out "YEAH! I mean YES!"
                                                    I felt like I had to be more formal about it.
